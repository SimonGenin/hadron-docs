**Hadron's purpose is to facilitate the building of Node.js applications:**

### Low-level framework-agnostic

Your application is built independently from other frameworks (Express, Koa). Hadron creates a layer between HTTP requests and your app written in plain Javascript.

Hadron abstracts away underlying request and response objects, providing simple data structures as input/output of your routes' handlers, making them simple to test and easy to deal with.

### Dependency injection

The dependency injection pattern enables you to easily change interface implementation. Hadron gives us the power to create SOLID applications.

Containers as a dependency management solution provides a convenient way to access all dependencies in functions.

### Modular structure

The modular structure enables you to add/remove packages or create your own extensions. Hadron provides a complete solution for request processing using separate packages.

Current packages:
* security management
* input validation
* database integration (through TypeORM)
* data serialization
* logging
* events handling
* CLI tool

Built with TypeScript, but it's primary target is JavaScript apps. Hadronâ€™s API embraces current ECMAScript standards, with the cherry of good IDE support via codebase types declarations on top.
